# Crack_Detection_Model
Developed a CNN-based model for automated structural crack detection, using Keras and Streamlit. Trained on image data to accurately classify cracks versus non-cracks, supporting real-time structural health monitoring. Demonstrated skills in deep learning, computer vision, and Python web app deployment.
